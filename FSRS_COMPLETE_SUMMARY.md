## üîÑ How It Works Now

### **Quiz Flow with FSRS:**

```
User Starts Quiz 1:
‚îú‚îÄ System loads UserProgress
‚îú‚îÄ Initializes FSRS metadata (all topics = 0 coverage)
‚îú‚îÄ Detects Phase 1
‚îú‚îÄ Selects uncovered topics (domain-balanced)
‚îî‚îÄ Generates 10 questions on those topics

User Completes Quiz 1:
‚îú‚îÄ Calls /api/pregenerate-quiz with completed questions
‚îú‚îÄ Updates metadata:
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Marks topics as covered (timesCovered++)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Calculates accuracy per topic
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Updates FSRS intervals (stability, difficulty)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Identifies struggling/mastered topics
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Checks if Phase 1 complete
‚îú‚îÄ Saves to Firestore:
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ quizMetadata (with FSRS data)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ topicPerformance (synced)
‚îî‚îÄ Logs phase and topic stats

User Starts Quiz 2:
‚îú‚îÄ System loads updated FSRS metadata
‚îú‚îÄ Detects Phase 1 (still has uncovered topics)
‚îú‚îÄ Selects different uncovered topics
‚îî‚îÄ Generates questions

... continues until all topics covered ...

Quiz N (all topics covered):
‚îú‚îÄ Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 transition!
‚îú‚îÄ Logs: "üéâ Phase 1 Complete! Entering Phase 2"
‚îî‚îÄ Future quizzes focus on struggling topics
```

---

## üìä Three-Phase System

### **Phase 1: Initial Coverage**
**Goal:** Cover all topics across all 5 domains at least once

**Topic Selection:**
- Prioritizes topics with `timesCovered === 0`
- Domain-balanced (ensures all domains get attention)
- Round-robin across domains

**Completion Criteria:**
- All topics in `topicCoverage` have `timesCovered >= 1`
- System sets `allTopicsCoveredOnce = true`
- Logs: "üéâ Phase 1 Complete at Quiz N"

**Example:**
```
Quiz 1: Selects 10 uncovered topics from domains 1, 2, 3
Quiz 2: Selects 10 different uncovered topics from domains 2, 4, 5
...
Quiz 15: Last uncovered topics ‚Üí Phase 1 Complete!
```

---

### **Phase 2: Focus on Weak Areas**
**Goal:** Reinforce struggling topics with FSRS intervals

**Topic Selection Distribution:**
- **50% Struggling** (accuracy < 60%)
- **30% Learning** (accuracy 60-79%)
- **20% Mastered** (accuracy ‚â• 80%)

**FSRS Intervals:**
- Wrong answer ‚Üí Next review in 1 quiz
- Correct answer ‚Üí Interval doubles (2 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 15 quizzes)

**Completion Criteria:**
- 70% of topics mastered OR
- 50 quizzes completed
- Logs: "üéì Phase 2 Complete! Entering Phase 3"

**Example:**
```
Topic: "SQL Injection"
  - Quiz 16: Wrong ‚Üí Next review: Quiz 17
  - Quiz 17: Correct ‚Üí Next review: Quiz 19 (2 quizzes later)
  - Quiz 19: Correct ‚Üí Next review: Quiz 23 (4 quizzes later)
  - Quiz 23: Correct ‚Üí Next review: Quiz 31 (8 quizzes later)
```

---

### **Phase 3: Maintenance & Mastery**
**Goal:** Maintain retention with minimal repetition

**Topic Selection Distribution:**
- **20% Struggling** (if any slip below 60%)
- **30% Due Mastered** (long intervals, 10-15 quizzes)
- **50% Random Variety** (keep learning fresh)

**FSRS Intervals:**
- Longer maximum intervals (up to 20 quizzes)
- Focuses on preventing forgetting

**Example:**
```
Most topics mastered, occasional reviews:
  - SQL Injection: Review every 15 quizzes
  - CSRF Attacks: Review every 12 quizzes
  - New struggling topic appears: Review every 1-2 quizzes
```

- Adaptive to YOUR learning patterns
- Focuses time on weak areas
- Maintains mastered topics efficiently

### **User Experience:**

## üîß Configuration

### **Adjustable Parameters:**

**FSRS Settings** (`lib/fsrsQuiz.ts`):
```typescript
// Average quizzes per week (affects interval conversion)
const avgQuizzesPerWeek = 3.5; // 1 quiz every 2 days

// Can be customized per user based on actual frequency
```

**Phase 2 Distribution** (`lib/topicSelectionFSRS.ts`):
```typescript
const strugglingCount = Math.ceil(count * 0.5);  // 50%
const learningCount = Math.ceil(count * 0.3);    // 30%
const masteredCount = count - strugglingCount - learningCount; // 20%
```

**Mastery Thresholds** (`lib/fsrsMetadataUpdate.ts`):
```typescript
topicPerf.isMastered = topicPerf.accuracy >= 80 && topicPerf.questionsAnswered >= 3;
topicPerf.isStruggling = topicPerf.accuracy < 60 && topicPerf.questionsAnswered >= 2;
```

## ‚ùå What's NOT Implemented (Future Enhancements)

### **Question Repetition** (Optional - Can Add Later)
- Currently: 100% new questions every quiz
- Future: Phase 2 (70% new, 30% repeated), Phase 3 (50% new, 30% repeated, 20% struggling)
- Challenge: Need storage for full questions with answers
- Benefit: Even better retention through spaced repetition of exact questions

### **FSRS Parameter Optimization** (Optional)
- Currently: Uses default FSRS parameters for all users
- Future: Learn user-specific parameters from quiz history
- Benefit: 5-10% additional efficiency improvement

### **Migration for Existing Users** (Nice to Have)
- Currently: Works perfectly for new users, existing users start fresh
- Future: Calculate initial metadata from existing quiz history
- Benefit: Existing users get immediate FSRS benefits
