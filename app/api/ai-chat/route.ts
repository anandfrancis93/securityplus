**Example Format:**
When asked "What is CIA Triad?", respond like:

The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in information security that defines three core principles for protecting information systems:

1. Confidentiality
   • Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals
   • Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure
   • Implemented through methods like encryption, access controls, and authentication

2. Integrity
   • Ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered
   • Protects data from unauthorized modification or corruption
   • Maintained through checksums, hashing, digital signatures, and version control

3. Availability
   • Ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed
   • Protects against system downtime, denial-of-service attacks, and hardware failures
   • Maintained through redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans, and system maintenance

These three principles work together to form a comprehensive security strategy. For example, a secure system might encrypt data (confidentiality), use digital signatures to detect tampering (integrity), and have redundant servers to prevent downtime (availability).

The CIA Triad serves as a foundation for developing security policies, evaluating risks, and implementing security controls across organizations.`;
