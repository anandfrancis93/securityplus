## KEY PATTERNS OBSERVED

### 1. OPTION LENGTH BY DIFFICULTY

**EASY:**
- Predominantly 1-2 words (75% of examples)
- Occasionally 8-11 words for purpose/function questions (25%)
- **Rule:** Keep options very short - usually single words or brief phrases

**MEDIUM:**
- Mix of 1-4 words (most common)
- Sometimes full phrases (5-10 words) for detailed scenarios
- **Rule:** Short to moderate length, context-dependent

**HARD:**
- 7-20 words (detailed strategies/solutions)
- Complete sentences or compound phrases
- **Rule:** Longer, more detailed options with multiple components

### 2. OPTION RELATEDNESS

**100% of examples follow this rule:**
- ALL 4 options are from the SAME domain/category
- NO unrelated distractors

**Examples:**
- CISO question: All are executive roles (CIO, CTO, CEO, CISO)
- SAML question: All are auth/access technologies (SAML, VPN, LDAP, LSASS)
- Firewall question: All mention Layer 4 or Layer 7 deployment
- Sandbox question: All are endpoint security purposes

### 3. CORRECT ANSWER POSITION

Analyzing correct answer positions across all 16:
- Position 0 (A): 2 times
- Position 1 (B): 4 times
- Position 2 (C): 3 times
- Position 3 (D): 3 times
- Multiple: 4 times

**No obvious pattern - well distributed**

### 4. KEYWORD MATCHING ANALYSIS

**EASY questions:**
- Often repeat keywords (e.g., "sandbox" in question and "sandbox" implied in answer)
- Direct terminology matching is ACCEPTABLE for easy questions

**MEDIUM questions:**
- Some keyword repetition for technical terms (SAML, IPS, SFTP)
- Scenario provides context, answer is specific term

**HARD questions:**
- Less direct keyword matching
- Answer requires synthesis of concepts from question

### 5. QUESTION STRUCTURE

**EASY (2-3 sentences):**
1. Context sentence (who/what)
2. Direct question ("What is...", "Which position...", "What sector...")

**MEDIUM (2-5 sentences):**
1. Scenario setup (1-2 sentences)
2. Additional context/requirement (1-2 sentences)
3. Question ("What/Which...")

**HARD (3-5 sentences):**
1. Complex scenario (2-3 sentences, multiple stakeholders/requirements)
2. Constraints or additional factors (1 sentence)
3. Question (often "MOST critical", "best combination", etc.)

### 6. DISTRACTORS ARE "CLOSE BUT WRONG"

**Example - CISO question:**
- Correct: CISO (security officer)
- Distractors: CIO, CTO, CEO (all executive roles, plausible but wrong function)

**Example - Layer 7 question:**
- Correct: Deploy Layer 7 firewalls (protects against app-specific attacks)
- Distractors: All mention Layer 4 (wrong layer for app attacks)

**Example - Asset Management:**
- Correct: Software disposal policy, Regular audits
- Distractors: Plaintext passwords (obviously insecure), Network segmentation (not asset management)

### 7. "MOST" and Superlatives

**Hard questions often use:**
- "MOST suitable"
- "MOST critical"
- "best combination"
- "essential factors"

**This signals:** Requires judgment, not just recall

## UPDATED QUALITY RULES BASED ON ACTUAL EXAMPLES

### LENGTH VARIATION

**EASY Questions:**
- Options: 1-2 words (75% of cases) OR 8-12 words for purpose/function questions (25%)
- Keep all options SAME length within each question
- Examples: "CIO, CTO, CEO, CISO" or "Energy, Fabrication, Facilities, Industrial"

**MEDIUM Questions:**
- Options: 1-5 words typically, up to 10 words for detailed scenarios
- Can vary slightly but generally similar length
- Examples: "SAML, VPN, LDAP, LSASS" or "IDS, IPS, NIDS, HIDS"

**HARD Questions:**
- Options: 7-20 words each
- Complete strategies or multi-component solutions
- Can vary in length but all should be substantive
- Example: "Deploy Layer 4 firewalls on all network edges" (8 words)

### PLAUSIBLE DISTRACTORS

**All 16 examples show:**
- 100% of options from SAME category/domain
- Wrong answers are "sibling concepts" not "distant cousins"
- If correct answer is an executive role, ALL options are executive roles
- If correct answer is a protocol, ALL options are protocols
- If correct answer is a firewall strategy, ALL options are firewall strategies

### KEYWORD MATCHING

**Actual pattern:**
- EASY: Direct keyword matching is FINE ("What is sandbox?" → "To isolate...")
- MEDIUM: Technical terms can repeat (SAML, IPS), but in context
- HARD: Less repetition, requires understanding relationships

**DO NOT over-avoid keywords** - the examples show moderate repetition is normal

### TECHNICAL DEPTH

**All options in each question:**
- Same level of specificity
- Same format (all acronyms OR all phrases OR all full sentences)
- Same domain/category

### SUBTLE INCORRECTNESS

**Examples from actual questions:**
- CISO: CIO, CTO are close roles but wrong function
- Layer 7: Layer 4 firewalls mentioned 3 times (wrong layer, right technology type)
- Salt: TPM, IPSec are security tools but don't add random values to hash
- Asset Management: Network segmentation is security practice but not asset management

---

## CONCLUSION

The current quality rules have these issues:
1. ❌ "15-60 words" is TOO RESTRICTIVE - actual examples use 1-20 words
2. ❌ "Avoid keyword matching" is OVERSTATED - examples show moderate repetition is fine
3. ❌ "Make some incorrect answers longer" - examples show consistent length per difficulty
4. ✅ "All options same domain" - CONFIRMED by 100% of examples
5. ✅ "Subtle incorrectness" - CONFIRMED (sibling concepts, wrong use case)

**Need to rewrite rules to match actual Security+ patterns.**
